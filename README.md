## 1. Description

It provides users with a number of prompts to allow them to selection of desired password length between 8-128 characters, and choices of character types including lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

## 4. Installation

The app can be used in browser, using html, css, and Javascript.

## 5. Usage

This application can be used as a password generator, which will generate a random password between 8-128 characters long, with a user selection of character types. The Javascript file provides comments to identify different parts of code and its function.

The Javascript file contains variables for input types, including alpha-numerical, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters. It uses conditional statements to:
<p>•	Remind the user the allowable password length</p>
<p>•	Check the correct characters are entered into the text boxes</p>
<p>•	Generate prompts to provide user choice of character types</p>

This app uses a for loop to randomize the password, and uses event listeners to provide interactivity.
